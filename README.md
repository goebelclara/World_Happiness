## Project description:
The following analysis aims to generate deeper insights into world happiness and its underlying variables.

The [dataset](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/) used is the 2019 World Happiness Report by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This dataset provides a happiness ranking of 136 countries based on the Gallup World Poll survey in 2018. The ranking revolves around the “Life Ladder” score, providing a rating of the respondents’ current life situation. It is suggested that a country’s Life Ladder score may be driven by several variables, including subjective measures, such as perceptions of freedom, and objective measures, such as GDP.
